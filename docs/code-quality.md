### Code Quality

This code project must follow [SOLID](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID) principles and keep high quality according to prerequisites defined by architecture.

To ensure the code quality we recommend read about the [Vue.js Style Guide]([https://vuejs.org/v2/style-guide/) to writing your components and the [JS Tests Style Guide](https://github.com/mawrkus/js-unit-testing-guide#structure-your-tests-properly) to build your unit tests
 
We recommend reading the [Atomic Design](http://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/) manual for good maintainability into project architecture

For the front-end development, be sure to follow those best practices:

- Use Semantic Elements on your HTML
- Follow the identation rule of editorconfig file
- Do not use !important if you can specify the element
